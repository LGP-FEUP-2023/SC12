### Get To Know

- Hugo and Matilde explained the project to further extents and what was already done:
    - the technology regarding computer vision is being developed by MOG;
    - the camera system was already been thought off by MOG;
- The product vision was established: an AI highlights for amateur paddle matches, and after usage creates a 5 min breakdown of all highlights;
- We discussed how to manually activate a highlight: through human gestures (e.g. thumbs up);
- The main clients for this product were clarified: padel pitch owners and their clients.


### Communication
- We decided communication would be done through slack or discord, the links would be sent in a future email.

### Technical Discussion
- Hugo informed us the smartwatch app should be both for apple (WatchOS) && android watches (WearOS), furthermore, the watch should:
    - show the game's score
    - send sensor information: heartbeat rate, oxygen levels, gyroscope, etc.;
    - trigger camera zoom on the player
- Hugo indicated that the connection to MOG's API will be given to us in the future;
- It was decided that the product would have a phone app that would be connected to the cloud (MOG's system) and the watch;
- Hugo clarified that UI/UX was not our main priority and that Matilde would help us in that department;
- Hugo informed MOG would try to get the team smartwatch models for software testing;
- Hugo pointed out that the smartwatch battery life should be considered for the smartwatch app;
- The Tech-stack was not established, further investigation needs to be done to decide which technologies are the most fitting for android/apple wearable app development.

    - SmartWatch App;
