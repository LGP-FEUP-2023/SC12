## Discussion Items

### Review Sprint #3 Progress
- We showed Hugo the phone app and the smartwatch app, and he was pleased with the progress we have made, and gave the following feedback:
    - change the logo to PADEL4PRO on the phone app;
    - return the points of a set to 0 when the set/game points are updated;
    - the tutorial for the smartwatch could be in the smartwatch itself, but as it is (phone) is fine.

- MOG was pleased with the UI & UX of our apps and how they looked in person;
- The iOS was officially discarded, and we will focus on the Android app for the rest of the project;
- Hugo wasn't able to provide a smartwatch in the meeting, so a meeting will be scheduled for next week to test the smartwatch app on a physical device;

### API OnBoarding
- Hugo proposed that we plan the endpoints to be implemented in the API, and then he would implement them;
- Hugo will in the future give us information about the VIZI API and how to access its login/signup endpoints;


### Presentation & LGP Challenge Day
- We discussed the presentation's structure and content, and we had the following ideas for the presentation:
    - Live demonstration with 4 players;
    - Filming the highlight in the prior day, so we can show the highlight in the presentation;
    - Have a cameo;
    - Video demonstration of the interviews we did with possible clients, presented in a grid-like format (3x3 or 4x4);
    - Mention our language choices: Portuguese, English, and of course, Croatian.
    - Finish with a good and serious punchline.
- We informed Hugo about the poster that will be presented on the LGP Challenge Day, and that we'll show it to him before the event to have his feedback.
