### Review Sprint #3 
- Due to the circumstances, we were not able to show Hugo the progress we made in the last sprint, but we told him the features we implemented and the ones we didn't;
- We showed Hugo our initial idea for the API, and he agreed with the design and gave us some feedback;
- Hugo was pleased with the progress and said for us to focus on the UI of the MVP, and that we should not worry about the API, since he would implement it;

### Sprint #4 plan 
- We told Hugo our plan for the final sprint, and he agreed with it and reinforced the importance of the UI;


### Smartwatch App Physical test
- We told Hugo about the problems we had with the smartwatch he sent us: it came with TisonOS installed and not WearOS, and with the investigation we did it is not possible to install WearOS on it;
- However, we found a way to install outside application on TisonOS by using a app installer in a phone, but we were not able to test it yet;
- Hugo said he comprehended the situation and if we were not able to test it, it would not be a problem;
