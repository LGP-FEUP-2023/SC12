## Discussion Items

### MVP Readjustment
- We explained to Hugo the readjustment of the MVP, namely the removal of the communication between the smartwatch and the phone due to:
    - The impossibility of installing WearOS on the smartwatch, which was running TisonOS;
    - The lack of support for BLE communication with the phone and the smartwatch;

- Hugo said he understood, however, gave some guidance:
    - The Bluetooth connection could be simulated in the PC with 2 emulators;
    - He said for us to try another approach, even network communication since this would add significantly to our project's scientific value;

- We agreed with Hugo and said we would attempt it;

### Review Sprint #4 
- We showed Hugo the improvements we made in the last sprint, and he was pleased with the improvements, regarding the:
    - Phone menu;
    - Login/Registration screen on the phone;
    - Smartwatch "waiting for phone sync" screen;



### Product State Evaluation
- We told Hugo that he was impressed with the progress we made, and that we were on track to deliver the MVP;


### Refinement
- Besides the attempt to implement communication between the phone and smartwatch, the other point was to finish the issues that were not completed;
