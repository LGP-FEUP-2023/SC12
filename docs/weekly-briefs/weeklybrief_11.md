## Current Status
- "Queima das Fitas" week, not much progress was work was done regarding the issues;
- We had some progress in the setup of the installer for the smartwatch app;
- We had a meeting with the client in their office, where we showed smartwatch and phone applications in person, discussed and planned the API, brainstormed the presentation, and discussed the future of the project;

## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish sprint 3 issues;
- Have a meeting with the team to review sprint 3 and plan sprint 4;
- Have Hugo send us a WearOS smartwatch for testing;
- Write the script for the presentation;
- Do interviews with potential users of the application in a padel court;


## Potential Risks
- Difficulties advancing with sprint 4 issues, due to the cumulative work from other courses;
- Delays and spillovers from sprint 3, due to the off week;
- Problems with the filming of the interviews, since we won't have professional equipment.
