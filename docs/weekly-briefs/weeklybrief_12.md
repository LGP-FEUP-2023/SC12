# Weekly Brief #12 (12/5-19/5)
-----------

## Current Status
- We finished sprint 3, which added:
    - Smartwatch: tiling and score UI/UX upgrades
    - Phones: snackbars for the QR code reading, scoreboard when no court is loaded, leave & join court logic.
- We receive the smartwatch from the client, however, no progress was made regarding the tests of the smartwatch app on the device due to the hardware limitations of the device, which came with a different
operating system than the one we were expecting.
- The communication smartwatch-phone was still a challenge to implement, further investigation on the topic will continue to be made;
- We continued sprint 4, the final one, which includes the features to finish the MVP;
- We interviewed potential users of the app in a padel court, to gather feedback and footage for the presentation;
- We finished the media kit and did progress on the presentation script.

## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish sprint #4
- Finish testing the smartwatch application on a physical device;
- Finish the presentation script;
- Start the presentation slides;
- Start the poster;
- Finish the testing and github action setup for both the smartwatch and phone applications;
- Finish the project.


## Potential Risks
- Due to the hardware limitations of the smartwatch, we might not be able to test the smartwatch app on a physical device;
- Due to the amount of work we have, either from the project or from other courses, the project might take longer than expected to finish.
