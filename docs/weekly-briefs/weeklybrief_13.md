# Weekly Brief #13 (20/5-26/5)
-----------

## Current Status
- We finished sprint 4, which added:
    - Phone menu;
    - Login/Registration screen on the phone;
    - Smartwatch "waiting for phone sync" screen;

- We discovered the incapability of sideloading apps on the smartwatch given by the client, which had TizenOS, which means we won't be able to test the smartwatch app on a physical device;
- We found how vague the resources and packages for BLE communication with the smartwatch are in React-Native, and how it is not suited for our use case;
- We had a meeting with the Client, where we communicated the incapability of testing the smartwatch app on a physical device, and discussed the future of the project:
    - He told us to try to emulate the Bluetooth connection and approaches try to test different ways of connecting the smartwatch and phone, like the networks;
    - After showing him the improvements made to the phone app and smartwatch app, he was very pleased with the results and UI/UX of the apps;
- We elaborated the MVP's documentation, which explains the MVP's features and its building process as a whole;
- We planned next week's schedule to elaborate on the elevator pitch, poster, and presentation;

## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish the issues from sprint 4;
- Finish the testing and GitHub action setup for both the smartwatch and phone applications;
- Finish the project;
- Finish the elevator pitch and film it;
- Create the poster;
- Create the presentation slides;


## Potential Risks
- Scheduling issues regarding the elevator pitch filming;
- Finding yet more issues with the smartwatch-phone communication, since it is a very complex topic with little documentation;
