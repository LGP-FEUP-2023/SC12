# Weekly Brief #7 (10/4-16/4)
-----------

## Current Status
- Review sprint 1, with the following features:
    - Phone app boilerplate
    - Phone app homepage scaffolding
    - Connect and disconnect from court buttons (without the inherent functionality)
    - Smartwatch app boilerplate
    - Smartwatch app homepage
    - Smartwatch scoreboard (without the inherent functionality of changing the score)
- Planned sprint 2 with the following features;
- Had a meeting with Hugo from MOG where we:
    - Updated on the state of the project;
    - Discussed the next features;
    - Defined the dynamic of the meetings, since Hugo will be abroad for the next 2-3 weeks working at a conference;


    


## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish the spillover tasks from sprint 1;
- Start sprint 2;
- Decide the future of the iOS smartwatch app, since the team doesn't have access to the necessary hardware, we are waiting for the client's response on this matter;

## Potential Risks
- Delayed communication with the client, which can hinder the decision of the iOS smartwatch app;
- Slow start of sprint 2, since the team is still getting used to the new workflow, technologies, and work from the previous sprint to be finished.
