# Weekly Brief #7 (17/4-23/4)
-----------

## Current Status
- Reviewed the sprint 2 status, good progress was made on the issues and everything seems to be going according to the issues assigned;

- The team decided to dismantle the ios team and assign the members to the other teams, since the client didn't respond to the team's request for the necessary hardware to develop the app and holding on would be a waste of resources. The team will still be responsible for the ios app, but it will be developed in the future, when the team has access to the necessary hardware;

- Since the Android Smartwatch team and Phone app team had new members, new features were thought of and new issues were created:
    - showing statistics and vitals on the smartwatch;
    - login page on the smartwatch;
    - language options of the smartwatch and phone.




    


## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish the tasks of sprint 2.
- Schedule a meeting with Hugo to discuss the next sprint and the future of the project.
- Start sprint 3.

## Potential Risks
- Delayed communication with the client, which can hinder the decision for the project;
- Problems with the new technologies, since we'll be using bluetooth to try to sync the smartwatch and phone data and QR codess, which are new for the team;
