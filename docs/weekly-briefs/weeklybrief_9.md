# Weekly Brief #9 (24/4-30/4)
-----------

## Current Status
- Finished sprint 2:
    - Sync screens were created, however, the logic behind them is not yet implemented;
    - The smartwatch main menu has been updated, however, some color changes are missing;
    - Smartwatch tiling isn't finished;
    - The language support had improvements and the research on the subject was done, however, it wasn't implemented yet;
    - Mockups for the login and recover password pages were created, however, they were not implemented;

- In general, there were a lot of spillovers from sprint 2, which will be finished in sprint 3. The team is motivated to try to change this in the next sprint.
- The team got updated on the Client: Hugo sent an email saying we would be able to give us the MacOS machine for remote access and requested a meeting for Tuesday between 16h-19h. The team decided on the time and responded accordingly.

- The team discussed the current state of the project: what has been accomplished and what needed to be done to finish the MVP. We concluded that the iOS needed to be discarded since it does not add that much value to the MVP, compared to the time it would take to develop it.

- We planned sprint 3:
    - Finish the spillover from sprint 2;
    - Implement the logic behind the sync screens;
    - Fix the score increment in the smartwatch, making it more user-friendly;
    - Synchronization of the smartwatch score with the phone score;
    - Implement language support;
    - Implement the login and recover password pages;
    - Implement the settings page
    - Implement the tutorial/help page and initial screen;
    - Create UI features for the phone, such as popups and alerts suggesting to the user the output of its actions. e.g. scanning a QR code.

- Due to the academic week happening in the week of 8/5-14/5, the team decided to have a meeting on Monday, 15/5, to discuss sprint 3 and the future of the project.

    


## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish the spillover from sprint 2;
- Meetup next Tuesday to discuss the future of the project with the client: iOS app, API, the current state of the project;
- Advance with the issues of sprint 3;



## Potential Risks
- Unavailability of the client to meet up;
- Disagreeing with the client regarding the priority of the iOS app;
- Unavailability of hardware to test the application: namely the smartwatch;
- Difficulties advancing the issues due to the need to refactor to make the application function with Bluetooth;
- Difficulties advancing the issues due to the work-related to other courses.
