# Weekly Brief #8 (24/4-30/4)
-----------

## Current Status
- Finished sprint 2:
    - Sync screens were created, however the logic behind them is not yet implemented;
    - The smartwatch mainmenu has been updated, however some color changes are missing;
    - Smartwatch tiling isn't finished;
    - The language support had improvements and the research on the subject was done, however it wasn't implemented yet;
    - Mockups for the login and recover password pages were created, however they were not implemented;

- In general, there were alot of spillovers from sprint 2, which will be finished in sprint 3. The team is motivated to try to change this in the next sprint.
- The team got updated on the Client: Hugo sent an email saying we would be able to give us the MacOS machine for remote access, and requested a meeting for Tuesday between 16h-19h. The team decided on the time and responded accordingly.

- The team discussed the current state of the project: what has been accomplishe and what needed to be done to finish the MVP. We concluded that the iOS needed to be discarded, since it does not had that much value to the MVP, compared to the time it would take to develop it.

- We planned the sprint 3:
    - Finish the spillover from sprint 2;
    - Implement the logic behind the sync screens;
    - Fix the score increment in the smartwatch, making it more user friendly;
    





    


## Plans for Coming Weeks
- Finish the tasks of sprint 2.
- Schedule a meeting with Hugo to discuss the next sprint and the future of the project.
- Start sprint 3.

## Potential Risks
- Delayed communication with the client, which can hinder the decision for the project;
- Problems with the new technologies, since we'll be using Bluetooth to try to sync the smartwatch and phone data and QR codes, which are new for the team;
