# Introduction slides - 1 && 2
Good Afternoon everyone! My name is **** (and I'm ****) and we are here to present you our company, H4PRO, product and our vision for the future of sports.
## slide - 3
(vision) H4PRO was born from a shared vision with MOG Technologies, to bring inovation to sports aided by technology, more specificaly, making media creation and visualization easier and dynamic.
In that regard, our comapany, H4PRO, in partnership with MOG Technologies, focuses on trying to provide a new way of creating and visualizing highlights for sports, generater automatically from the game itself. (mission) Our Mission is to give people a more dynamic and compelling experience by giving them a way to record their hmmighlights in a more efficient way, which can be later analysed, shared and enjoyed.
## slide - 4
Our team is composed of 9 students from the masters of informatics and computing engineering and 2 students from the master in Services Engineering and Management


## slide - 5 - 6
So now we are going to present our product and the first iteration of our mission, Padel4PRO.
As you may have noticed, in the last years, technology has been more involved with professional sports than ever, in football now the game can be paused by referee to access the VAR system, 
in tennis the Hawk-Eye system is used to determine if the ball was in or out, and when we start to reflect on this, why hasn't this technology tansitioned to more casual players, why can't I, for example, in a game of Padel with friends review the last play so I can prove to my oponnent in a mater of seconds that I was right about the ball being off or at the end of the game review the best plays and highlights of our match? And media advertisement has been rampant, 
NBA players use short videos to advertise their flashy moves on social media, and again, why didn't this technology come to a more casual player base.
For once having a large team of people to record the game is not an option, and for the other, so why not have a system that can do both? 
That's where Padel4PRO comes in, a dynamic highlight recording and visualization for Padel, controlled by your smartwatch. We achieve this by using the MOG system, which is a system that uses a camera to record, analyze the game, and create AI based highlights for the players. And this is how our product would look implemented in a padel court:
- Cameras on each corner of the court, a tv where you could see the recorded footage, and, of course, you would have your smartwatch to control the system.

# slide 7
Regarding the functionalities that concern our project, they consist in three key areas: Watching and recording replays and important moments of the game in the big screen or your phone,, checking games statistics on demand like results and points scored and display possible fouls to assist in judging referree decisons. 

# slide 8
After a survey concerning the importance of these features, more than half of padel players consider highlight saving and recording an important very importan feature. Another matter we wanted to ascertain was the availability of players to use their own smartwatch during a game to track statistics and save replays which our results came to confirm.

# slide 9
As we can observe, the project encompasses different components, the court screen and cameras are connected and managed by MOG in their servers. Our job is to build the phone and smartwatch applications that interface with each other and the these servers. Note that both of these apps will be able to work independently. The system will work by scanning the courts qrcode with the phone app and connect the players phone and watch with the courts components.

# slide 10
The technologies that are needed by the project are kotlin for building wearos (android wearables) applications and swift for watchos(apple wearables) since these technologies are mandatory to build a smartwatch app for apple and android. Regarding the phone app, react native is the teams preferred candidate because it runs on both systems.

# slide 11
Now, our development plan is organised in sprints of 2 weeks, where the first 2 sprints are 2 iterations dedicated to the development of the smartwatch app, consequently, there is another sprint for the development of the phone app and a last for validation and documentation

# slide 12-14
In the end, the development of the smartwatch and phone app for both android and ios is our main goal with the mentioned functionlities and mechanisms.

In this slide you can have glimpse of how this product is going to look.

so, that's it for our presentation, we are ready to try to inovate sports and bring a new dynamic to the game of padel. Thank you for your attention
